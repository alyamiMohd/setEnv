# setEnv
If you ever find yourself opening multiple programs, chrome tabs, and taking a chunk of your time 'daily', I think you might like this simple project, This project provides: -Opening all your desired apps -Organizing them via Windows Multitasking -Write on your specific apps *optional*, and all of this won't take a second of your precious time!
(The reason why I made this project, is that every single day, I open (2 google tabs, 3 git bash windows, vs, spotify, ...), in 2 separate monitors, and here's what it looks like:

So it took a huge part of my time daily, and after making the project, that's how it went

Now, let's get into the tutorial:
To set up your (setEnv) Application:
(You have to create a folder that contains all your apps wanted in a .cmd file with the command prompt of "start {yourAppName}.exe", then copying that path, and adding it to
your environment variables) before anything, if you did so, then follow these steps:

1- Change the array contents to be your desired apps <br>

2- Change the arr[i]='myFileName' to arr[i] == '${your app name}' <br>

3- If you want a few apps only, you can delete and customize the way you want. <br>

4- You can set a shortcut to open the script without opening your python compiler. <br>
	(Go to the file location, create a shortcut => go to shortcut's properties => assign preferred key at 'Shortcut Key') <br>

5- You can also change time.sleep(x) to the time you like, if you want more convenient and faster program setup <br>
