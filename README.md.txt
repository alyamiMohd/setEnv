To set up your (setEnv) Application:
(You have to create a folder that contains all your apps wanted in a .cmd file with the command prompt of "start {yourAppName}.exe", then copying that path, and adding it to
your environment variables) before anything, if you did so, then follow these steps:

1- Change the array contents to be your desired apps
2- Change the arr[i]='myFileName' to arr[i] == '${your app name}'
3- If you want a few apps only, you can delete and customize the way you want.
4- You can set a shortcut to open the script without opening your python compiler.
5- You can also change time.sleep(x) to the time you like, if you want more convenient and faster program setup
